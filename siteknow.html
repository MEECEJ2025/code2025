    <h1>Part One</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Siteknow!</p>
    <p>Siteknow is a webpage for all users and age groups!</p>

    <p>Now that we have all of the links in, this is also an advocacy website.</p>
    <p>I do not share this around too much, but as a developer, I have ADHD.</p>
    <p>This is the first time I feel comfortable putting my code out there.</p>
    <p>I ask not to be judged because I am really shy and protective about my ADHD.</p>
    <p>This is also a place of safety. If you do not feel safe, please call your local police.</p>

    <h1>Part Two</h1>
